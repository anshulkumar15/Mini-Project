            <i> Music is an art that, in one guise or another, permeates every human society. Modern music is heard in 
                               
             bewildering profusion of styles, many of them contemporary, others engendered in past eras. Music is a protea

             art; it lends itself easily to alliances with words, as in song, and with physical movement, as in dance.

             Throughout history, music has been an important adjunct to ritual and drama and has been credited with the

             capacity to reflect and influence human emotion. Popular culture has consistently exploited these possibilities,

             most conspicuously today by means of radio, film, television, musical theatre, and the Internet. The

             of the uses of music in psychotherapy, geriatrics, and advertising testify to a faith in its power

             to affect human behaviour. </i></h2>
